This tiny programe is used to download you `accepted` solution in `poj.com` into your computer.

Pre-requirment,

1. python 2.x (not 3.x)
2. [BeautifulSoup 3.x] (https://github.com/Tokutek/ft-index) (not 4.x) (A library to liberate your hands)
3. [Pyyaml] (http://pyyaml.org/) (A better library to read the configuration, I only use it to read `config.yml`)
This basic idea of this tiny programe comes from [gettc](https://github.com/seri/gettc), a very great programe which download problems and solution and provide a tiny judge system.

For myself solution in POJ, you can find it in [example](https://github.com/mathetian/example/tree/master/codeDaily/POJ).
